1. Initialize the project go mod init github.com/ ....
2. Create main.go file
3. We would be installing our routing library:
      go get github.com/gorilla/mux
4. Edit the main.go file to Create routes using the library.
5. Serving Static files
   “Static files” are the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and the other static asset files that are needed to form a website.

    There are 2 steps we need to take in order to make our server serve these static assets.

    1. Create static assets
        To create static assets, create a directory in your project root directory, and name it assets :
        mkdir assets
        Create an HTML file inside this directory. This is the file we are going to serve, 
        along with any other file that goes inside the assets directory

    2. Modify our router to serve static assets
